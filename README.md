The pathway for decarbonizing the thermal energy sector is challenging and will lean heavily on electric heat pump technologies. It is also founded on the need to to reduce carbon emissions, but does not grant consideration to economic or infrastructure limitations. An elegant solution to alleviate these barriers is to enable demand flexibility, often referred to as flexible load management (FLM). This is the process of providing energy consuming devices (loads) connected to the electric grid with the ability to respond in real-time to better manage regional demand for electricity. Heat pumps are a prime candidate for leveraging FLM to lower operational costs while mitigating the need for system upgrades. This paper proposes a thermal state model using differential master equations to understand the system dynamics and state equilibria under real-world conditions. This model provides a foundation for understanding state distributions to better assess FLM practices.
